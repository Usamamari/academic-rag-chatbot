System Information:
This chatbot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based academic assistant.
It retrieves relevant information from research papers using TF-IDF similarity
and uses the LLaMA 3.1 language model via Groq API to generate detailed,
context-aware answers. The system strictly avoids hallucinations and only answers
based on available documents.
